## Scalable React / Typescript starter project
This boilerplate is a spin-off of the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) project.

The main difference, however, is that this project embraces TypeScript as the main language.  Babel is also supported, so use this to slowly introduce TS into your project.

## Feature First
This project follows the feature-first architecture.  Please read the [Scalable React](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) repository for more details.
